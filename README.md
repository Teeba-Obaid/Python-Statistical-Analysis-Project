# Python Statistical Analyses

## Project Overview
This GitLab repository hosts a project dedicated to in-depth statistical analyses using Python. The project is structured around several key components: datasets, analytical scripts, visualization outputs, and comprehensive results.

## Data
The data included in this project are essential for conducting various statistical tests and visualizations:
- **Primary Datasets**: Includes key experimental and control group data.
- **Case Studies**: Provides specific datasets used for detailed case analysis.

## Code
The Python scripts in this project provide a robust framework for statistical analysis and data visualization:
- **Exploratory and Descriptive Statistics**: Scripts for generating correlation matrices and conducting normality tests to assess data distributions and fundamental relationships.
- **Inferential Statistics**: Includes scripts for conducting ANOVA to examine differences among groups, Dunn's test for non-parametric multiple comparisons, and evaluating silhouette scores to assess the quality of existing clusters.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Utilizes Altair to create dynamic and interactive charts that include:
  - **Cluster Sequences and Frequencies**: Visualizations that explore the sequences and frequencies within previously analyzed clusters, highlighting patterns and characteristics of data grouping.
  - **Interactive Data Analysis Exploration**: Comprehensive visual tools such as heatmaps, line graphs, scatter plots, and other charts for examining relationships between variables, and comparing multiple comparisons and clustering effects across various groups.

## Visuals
Graphical representations generated from the analyses include:
- **Line Graphs and Heatmaps**: For visual comparison of trends and relationships across groups.
- **Cluster Bar Charts**: To illustrate the distribution and clustering of data points.
- **Diagnostic Plots**: Including tests for normality and variance.

## Results
Key outputs from the analyses include:
- **Correlation Assessments**: Detailed matrices showing variable interrelationships.
- **Statistical Tests**: Results from ANOVA, Tukey's, and Dunn's tests highlighting significant differences.
- **Visual Insights**: Altair-generated visuals that emphasize correlations and group comparisons.
